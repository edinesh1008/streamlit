 * - `row` -> Used when the parent is a `st.container` with
 *   `direction="horizontal"`.
 * - `column` -> Used when the parent is a `st.container` with
 *   `direction="vertical"`.
 *
 * Since Contexts work recursively, this means that any child component that

 * nearest `st.container` ancestor.
 *
 * Search the codebase for `<FlexContextProvider` to see where this is used.
