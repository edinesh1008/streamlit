# Streamlit E2E Tests

We use playwright with pytest to e2e test Streamlit library. E2E tests verify the complete Streamlit system (frontend, backend, communication, state, visual appearance) from a user's perspective (black-box). They complement Python/JS unit tests, which are faster and focus on internal logic, input/output validation, and specific message sequences. Use E2E tests when testing behavior that requires the full stack or visual verification, especially for new elements or significant changes to existing ones.

## Test Structure

- Located in `e2e_playwright/`
- Each test consists of two files:
  - `*.py`: Streamlit app script that's being tested
  - `*_test.py`: Playwright pytest file that runs the app and tests it
- If the test is specific to a Streamlit element, prefix the filename with `st_<element_name>`
- Tests can use screenshot comparisons for visual verification
- Screenshots are stored in `e2e_playwright/__snapshots__/<os>/`
- Other tests results are stored in `e2e_playwright/test_results/`

## Key Fixtures and Utilities

Import from from `conftest.py`:

- `app: Page` - Light mode app fixture
- `themed_app: Page` - Light & dark mode app fixture
- `assert_snapshot` - Screenshot testing fixture. Ensure element is stable before calling.
- `wait_for_app_run(app)` - Wait for app run to finish
- `wait_for_app_loaded(app)` - Wait for initial app load
- `rerun_app(app)` - Trigger app rerun and wait
- `wait_until(app, fn)` - Run test function until True or timeout

## Best Practices

- As a guiding principle, tests should resemble how users interact with the UI.
- Use `expect` for assertions, not `assert` (reduces flakiness)
- Prefer label- or key-based locators over index-based access, e.g. `get_by_test_id().nth(0)`. The recommended order of priority is:
  1. get elements by label (see `app_utils` methods, e.g. `get_text_input`).
  2. elements that don't support `label` but support `key`: get elements by a unique key (`get_element_by_key`).
  3. If the element doesn't support key or label, you can wrap it with an `st.container(key="my_key")` to better target it via `get_element_by_key`. E.g. `get_element_by_key("my_key").get_by_test_id("stComponent")`.
- Use `get_by_test_id` to locate elements preferentially. Use `.locator` only when necessary.
- If `expect` is insufficient, use the `wait_until` utility. Never use `wait_for_timeout`.
- Group related tests into single, logical test files (e.g., by widget or feature) for CI efficiency.
- Minimize screenshot surface area; screenshot specific elements, not the whole page unless necessary.
- Ensure elements screenshotted are under 640px height to avoid clipping by the header.
- Naming convention for command-related snapshots: `st_command-test_description`
- Take a look at other tests in `e2e_playwright/` as inspiration.
- e2e tests are expensive, please test every aspect only one time.

## Writing Tests & Common Scenarios

When adding or modifying tests for an element, ensure the following are covered:

- **Visuals:** Snapshot tests for both normal and `disabled` states.
- **Interactivity:** Test user interactions and verify the resulting app state or output (e.g., checking text written via `st.write`, potentially using helpers like `expect_markdown` from `shared/app_utils.py`).
- **Common Contexts:** Verify behavior within:
  - A `@st.fragment`.
  - An `st.form`.
- **Core Behavior:**
  - State persistence (widget value is retained) if the element is temporarily unmounted and remounted.
  - The element cannot be interacted with when `disabled=True`.
  - If the element uses the `help` parameter, verify the tooltip appears correctly on hover.
  - If the element uses the `key` parameter, verify a corresponding CSS class or attribute is set.
- **Custom Config:** Use module-scoped fixtures with `@pytest.mark.early` for tests requiring specific Streamlit configuration options.

## Running tests

- Single test: `make run-e2e-test e2e_playwright/name_of_the_test.py`
- Debug test: `make debug-e2e-test e2e_playwright/name_of_the_test.py`
- If frontend logic was changed, it will require running `make frontend-fast` to update the frontend.
- You can ignore missing or mismatched snapshot errors. These need to be updated manually.

- As a guiding principle, tests should resemble how users interact with the UI.
- Don't use index based (e.g. `get_by_test_id().nth(0)`). The recommended order of priority is:

  1. get elements by label (see `app_utils` methods, e.g. `get_text_input`). If necessary, please refactor the e2e script so that all the elements have a unique label.
  2. elements that don't support label but support key: get elements by a unique key (`get_element_by_key`). If the element doesn't yet have a key, please add one. But only add a unique key if the element actually needs to be targeted via key (and not via label as descibed above).
  3. If the element doesn't support key or label, you can wrap it with an `st.container(key="my_key")` to better target it via `get_element_by_key`. E.g. `get_element_by_key("my_key").get_by_test_id("stComponent")`

- Please replace `expect(app.get_by_test_id("stMarkdown")).to_have_text("text")` with `expect_markdown(app, "text")`.
- Please check if additional aspect can be easily replaced by using methods from `app_utils`.
